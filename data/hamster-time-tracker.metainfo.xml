  <summary>Project Hamster - track your time</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      Hamster is time tracking for individuals. It helps you to keep track of how
      much time you have spent during the day on activities you choose to track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you change from doing one task to other, you change your current
      activity in Hamster. After a while you can see how many hours you have spent on
      what. Maybe print it out, or export to some suitable format, if time reporting
      is a request of your employer.
    </p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fast and easy data entry with autocompletion of recent activities</li>
      <li>Flexible grouping with @categories and #tags</li>
      <li>Day, week, month or custom views with tallies by groups</li>
      <li>Generation of html reports (can be customized)</li>
      <li>Data export in text, xml and tsv formats</li>
    </ul>
