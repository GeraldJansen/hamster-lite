# Keyboard shortcuts

Hamster can be used very efficiently from the keyboard if desired. You may also
find it useful to bind either the command `hamster` or `hamster add` to a
keyboard application shortcut using your desktop UI settings.

The following key combinations can be used in the overview window.

`Left` or `Right`: Same as `<` or `>` buttons. Navigate backwards or forwards
in time.

`Down`/`Up`: Navigate the activity list, starting from the top/bottom
respectively, and select a previous activity.

`Home`/`End`: Navigate to the first or last activity in the list, respectively,
and select the activity.

`PageDown`/`PageUp`: Navigate the activity list if longer than one page.

`Ctrl`+`+`: Create a new activity. If an existing activity is selected, it will
be resumed (i.e. its details will be cloned, aside from the start time). Same as
the `+` button in the action bar.

`Ctrl`+`N` or `Ctrl`+`R`: Specifically create a New activity from scratch or
Resume an existing selected activity.

`Ctrl`+`Space`: Stop tracking the ongoing activity, if any. Same as the stop
button in the action bar.

`Return`: Edit/update the selected activity if any. Same as double click.

`Delete`: Delete the selected activity if any.


<hr>

*More `Ctrl` combinations*: The keys above without `Ctrl` can also be used in
combination with `Ctrl`, for example `Ctrl`+`Left`.
