# Backup

Activities are stored in an SQLite database, located at ~/.local/share/hamster/hamster.db (older versions: ~/.local/share/hamster-applet/hamster.db). The file can be backed up and restored on the go. The application will reload the data automatically after a short while.

TIP: For viewing contents of the database we can suggest using the DB Browser for SQLite ([DB4S](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)).
