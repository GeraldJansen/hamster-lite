# Keyboard shortcuts

Hamster can be used very efficiently from the keyboard if desired. You may also
find it useful to bind either the command `hamster-lite` or `hamster-lite add` to a
keyboard application shortcut using your desktop UI settings.

The following key combinations can be used in the overview window.

`Left` or `Right`: Same as `<` or `>` buttons. Navigate backwards or forwards
in time.

`Down`/`Up`: Navigate the activity list, starting from the top/bottom
respectively, and select a previous activity.

`Home`/`End`: Navigate to the first or last activity in the list, respectively,
and select the activity.

`PageDown`/`PageUp`: Navigate the activity list if longer than one page.

`Ctrl`+`+`: Create a new activity. If an existing activity is selected, it will
be resumed (i.e. its details will be cloned, aside from the start time). Same as
the `+` button in the action bar.

`Enter` or `Ctrl`+`R`: Resume an existing selected activity. 
`Enter` is the same as `Return`.

`Ctrl`+`N`: Create a New activity from scratch.

`Ctrl`+`Enter` or `Ctrl`+`E`: Edit/Update the selected activity if any. 
Same as double click.

`Ctrl`+`Space`: Stop tracking the ongoing activity, if any. Same as the stop
button in the action bar.

`Delete`: Delete the selected activity if any.


<hr>

*More `Ctrl` combinations*: Most keys above without `Ctrl` can also be used in
combination with `Ctrl`, for example `Ctrl`+`Left`. The exception is `Enter`.

*Note*: the behaviour of the `Enter`/`Return` keys in hamster-lite differs from
the main Hamster v2+ application.
